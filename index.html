        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I love to travel. Ever since I was able to first leave my home country- the United States- at 16 in order to visit Brazil, I've been fascinated with the idea of visiting other countries in the world. I have a pretty big list of places I plan to see throughout my life, but one place consistently at the top of my list is Australia. For the sake of having substance on this page, I'll give you guys five reasons I want to visit Australia.

        <h2>Reason I: Sydney, Australia</h2>
        <p>
            I remember my very first time seeing a picture of the Sydney Opera House. Even though I'm no fan of opera by any means, I thought it was by far one of the coolest architecturally designed buildings I had ever seen. I want to see it in person. I also really want to see the Sydney Harbor and take selfies on the bridge. 
        </p>

        <p>I've also heard really exciting things about Sydneysiders, from praises about how they party and their personalities all the way to how beautiful Sydneysider women are and how awesome the city is in general. </p>

        <p>I'm sure there are plenty of awesome people, things, and places (other than Sydney) worth visiting in Australia. Sydney is just what first attracted me in general.</p>

        <h2>Reason II: The Wildlife and the Reef</h2>
        <p>
             Fun fact- I can't swim! But that doesn't mean I wouldn't happily take a trip to see one of the most beautiful natural landmarks the world has to offer in The Great Barrier Reef. I waded in the Amazon River during my trip to Brazil, so I'd chance it. I'd very much love to see just how much marine wildlife Australia has to offer- especially the endemic species. It'd be even cooler if I could be in a boat- like the ones with the glass floor panels- so that I can see through the water over the reef and look at all of the wildlife as they carry on with their day-to-day stuff. That'd be legendary.

        <h2>Reason III: The Beaches</h2>
        <p>
             No, I'm not just talking about the ones that line Gold Coast either. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            One in particular that I'd like to see is Lucky Bay in Cape La Grand National Park. Apparently, the place is so chill that even the kangaroos take up residency on the sands also! How cool is that?

        <h2>Reason IV: Australian Wine</h2>
        <p>
             I'm not much of a drinker normally, but I'd be lying if I said that I wouldn't find it pretty exquisite to sip on some of Australia's finest wines from a really fancy glass while resting on a white, sandy beach. Australia has a very big wine culture scene and, apparently, produces some pretty top notch stuff from what I've heard. Would be nice to try.

        <h2>Reason V: Cricket and Australian Football</h2>
        <p>
             Cricket is without a doubt the most influential sport in Australia. I've actually never seen a cricket game myself but with how large of a scene the country has, and with how amazing their cricket stadiums look, I'd be doing myself a disservice by not checking it out. It'd be like coming to the United States and not watching a good ol' game of baseball. Did you even really go at that point?
